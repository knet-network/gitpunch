# GitPunch Notifier

AWS Lambda function that runs every minute. It behaves differently depending on the time it runs:

1. Every hour it fetches releases of all repos that are being watched in realtime or at that hour simultaneously purging SQS queue
2. Any other time it fetches releases of watched repos that also have their release events in SQS queue

These releases are then used to send emails and update users in the database to prevent duplicate emails

Example 1:

- Start at `15:03`
- Read `3` release events in SQS queue: `facebook/react`, `vuejs/vue` & `angular/angular`
- `4` users watch `facebook/react` & `vuejs/vue` in realtime
- Users watching daily are ignored
- Fetch releases of `facebook/react` & `vuejs/vue`
- Send emails to those `4` users

Example 2:

- Start at `16:00`
- Load all users that watch in realtime or daily at `16:00`
- Fetch releases of all their repos
- Send emails if there's anything new
- Delete all previous release events in SQS queue since all watched repos were fetched anyway

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Link the library as described [here](https://github.com/vfeskov/gitpunch/blob/master/lib/README.md)

Create `.env` file:

```bash

```

Open `.env` in a text editor and fill in the variables:
